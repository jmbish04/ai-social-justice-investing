Your combined prompt is already excellent ‚Äî it‚Äôs coherent, technically actionable, and expresses multi-agent orchestration clearly. Gemini‚Äôs merge actually preserved most of the critical Cloudflare scaffolding and strengthened the multi-guest logic.

Here‚Äôs a final, production-ready revision ‚Äî cleaned, standardized, and clarified for Claude Code.
I‚Äôve refined a few sections for precision and completeness while keeping all your Cloudflare bindings and multi-guest logic intact.

‚∏ª


You are Claude Code. You are working inside the existing GitHub repo:
**https://github.com/jmbish04/ai-social-justice-investing**

Your goal is to **extend** (not replace) the existing codebase by implementing:
- The Brainstorm Chat interface
- The Episode Page Chat interface
- The AI-driven multi-guest podcast generation pipeline

All code must run natively on **Cloudflare Workers + React**, be **deployable with Wrangler**, and conform to Cloudflare‚Äôs best practices for D1, R2, KV, Workflows, and the Agent SDK.

## ‚öôÔ∏è USE THESE EXACT BINDINGS (from wrangler.toml)

```toml
name = "sji-app"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-10-30"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "sji-app-db"
database_id = "34b476f8-1f88-4062-816d-2acfb3449a7d"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "KV"
id = "ae22b132a2fd453ca9cc04c1ab3b0da9"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "BUCKET"
bucket_name = "sji-app-public"

[vars]
R2_PUBLIC_URL = "https://sji-app-public.b3304b14848de15c72c24a14b0cd187d.r2.dev"
MODEL_REASONING = "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
MODEL_STT = "@cf/openai/whisper-base-en"

‚úÖ Use these exact IDs and bindings in all code and configuration files.

üß† GOALS
	1.	Add two generative chat experiences
	‚Ä¢	Brainstorm Chat Page for idea creation.
	‚Ä¢	Episode Chat Page for refining podcast outlines and transcripts.
	2.	Implement a complete AI-driven podcast generation system
	‚Ä¢	Support multiple guest agents per episode.
	‚Ä¢	Orchestrate workflows using Durable Objects, Cloudflare Actor Framework, Agent SDK, and Workflows/Queues.
	‚Ä¢	Store structured data in D1, audio in R2, and chat/session memory in KV.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically generate OpenAPI specs with @hono/zod-openapi.
	‚Ä¢	Serve all frontend content via the ASSETS binding (static Vite build).

‚∏ª

üß© ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

Data Persistence

Use D1 (DB) for:
	‚Ä¢	ideas
	‚Ä¢	threads
	‚Ä¢	messages
	‚Ä¢	episodes
	‚Ä¢	guest_profiles ‚Äî persona data for possible guests.
	‚Ä¢	episode_guests ‚Äî join table linking multiple guests to episodes.
	‚Ä¢	transcripts
	‚Ä¢	audio_versions

Use R2 (BUCKET) for podcast audio and transcript files.
Use KV (KV) for session and ephemeral chat memory.

‚∏ª

üîÅ AI + AGENT ORCHESTRATION

Durable Object
	‚Ä¢	ChatCoordinatorDO
	‚Ä¢	Maintains session context for Brainstorm Chat.
	‚Ä¢	Persists and recalls user memory.

Cloudflare Agents (Agent SDK)
	‚Ä¢	HostAgent ‚Äì Simulates Andrea‚Äôs voice/persona (The Social Justice Investor tone).
	‚Ä¢	GuestAgent ‚Äì Dynamically instantiated per guest, using their guest_profile record from D1.
	‚Ä¢	PodcastBuilderAgent ‚Äì Generates structured outlines and full transcripts for all participants (host + guests).
	‚Ä¢	AudioDirectorAgent ‚Äì Orchestrates or stubs audio synthesis and uploads to R2.

Each agent:
	‚Ä¢	Reads and writes memories to D1.
	‚Ä¢	Calls Workers AI models defined in env.MODEL_REASONING and env.MODEL_STT.

Actor Framework
	‚Ä¢	EpisodeActor
	‚Ä¢	Serializes workflows for each episode (avoids race conditions).

Workflows / Queues

Define a GeneratePodcastDemoWorkflow:
	1.	Fetch episode_guests for the episode.
	2.	Instantiate one GuestAgent per guest.
	3.	Pass all participants (Host + Guests) to PodcastBuilderAgent.
	4.	Build transcript outline and full multi-way dialogue.
	5.	Generate or stub audio segments.
	6.	Concatenate segments and upload to R2 at
podcasts/{episodeId}/v{version}.mp3.
	7.	Record metadata in D1 audio_versions table.

‚∏ª

üé® FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

React App

üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION & QUALITY RULES

1. AI-Agent Readability (MANDATORY)

Each .ts or .tsx file must begin with a clear docstring explaining its role.
Every exported function or class must include JSDoc comments with @param and @returns.

2. Modularity

Keep TypeScript modular, composable, and aligned with the existing repo‚Äôs folder hierarchy.
Do not flatten structure.

3. Technical Consistency
	‚Ä¢	Use Vite to build ‚Üí /dist
	‚Ä¢	Serve via ASSETS binding in Worker.
	‚Ä¢	Follow Cloudflare Docs MCP for all API patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Use @cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct (reasoning) and @cf/openai/whisper-base-en (STT).
	‚Ä¢	Generate OpenAPI dynamically from schemas.

4. Deployability

Final deployment must pass:

npx wrangler d1 migrations apply sji-app-db
npx wrangler publish


‚∏ª

‚úÖ DELIVERABLES

Claude should:
	1.	Detect and extend current repo structure (no overwrites).
	2.	Add all new components, Durable Objects, Agents, Actors, Workflows, and routes.
	3.	Implement D1 migrations for multi-guest tables.
	4.	Ensure /openapi.json and /openapi.yaml are generated correctly.
	5.	Validate R2 uploads resolve via R2_PUBLIC_URL.
	6.	Ensure React app compiles and serves correctly under wrangler dev.
	7.	Commit and push in logical increments with descriptive messages.

‚∏ª

Use your cloudflare-docs MCP for implementation references, Worker AI patterns, and Agent SDK usage.
Focus on clarity, maintainability, and modularity ‚Äî this codebase will be maintained primarily by AI developer agents.

### üîç Summary of Revisions
- Clarified **multi-guest orchestration logic** (guest instantiation + join tables).  
- Strengthened **OpenAPI, modularity, and docstring requirements** (critical for long-term AI maintenance).  
- Consolidated **frontend/React responsibilities** and explicitly added `GuestManager.tsx`.  
- Streamlined **deployment commands** and **data flow** consistency across DB + R2 + KV.  
- Ensured Cloudflare terminology and SDK usage match current 2025 docs.

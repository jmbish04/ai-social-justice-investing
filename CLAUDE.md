Here is a CLAUDE.md file designed to be placed in the root of your repository. This file acts as a persistent set of instructions, summarizing your requirements so you don't have to provide the full context every time you ask Claude to work on the repo.
You can just tell Claude: "Please follow the instructions, goals, and quality standards outlined in CLAUDE.md."
# ü§ñ CLAUDE.md - AI Agent Instructions

You are Claude Code. You are working inside the existing GitHub repo:
**https://github.com/jmbish04/ai-social-justice-investing**

Your goal is to **extend the existing codebase** ‚Äî not replace it. Follow all instructions in this file when making changes.

## üìú Core Mission

Your primary task is to evolve this repository by implementing AI-driven chat interfaces and a podcast generation pipeline. All features must be built using the Cloudflare-native stack (Workers, D1, R2, Agents, Actors) and a static React frontend.

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è CRITICAL: Code Quality & Style

This repository is **owned and maintained by AI developer agents**. Your code MUST be optimized for them.

1.  **AI-Agent Readability (Mandatory):**
    * **File-Level Docstrings:** Every new `.ts` and `.tsx` file **MUST** begin with a top-level docstring (`/** ... */`) explaining its purpose and its role in the application.
    * **Block-Level Docstrings:** All public functions, classes, methods, and complex logic blocks **MUST** have clear JSDoc-style docstrings explaining their function, parameters (`@param`), and return values (`@returns`).
    * **Clarity Over Brevity:** Use descriptive variable names and explicit logic.

2.  **Modularity:**
    * Write clean, highly modular TypeScript.
    * Create separate files for distinct concerns (routes, schemas, services, agents, actors).
    * Preserve and extend the existing repo structure.

3.  **Cloudflare Best Practices:**
    * Use the `cloudflare-docs` MCP to verify all Cloudflare-specific API patterns and configurations.
    * **NEVER** use placeholder bindings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture & Bindings

Use these **exact** bindings from `wrangler.toml` in all your code.

| Binding Type | Binding Name | Service |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D1 Database | `DB` | `sji-app-db` |
| R2 Bucket | `BUCKET` | `sji-app-public` |
| KV Namespace | `KV` | (ID: `...0da9`) |
| AI Model | `MODEL_REASONING` | `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` |
| AI Model | `MODEL_STT` | `@cf/openai/whisper-base-en` |
| Env Variable | `R2_PUBLIC_URL` | `https://sji-app-public...r2.dev` |

**Tech Stack:**
* **Backend:** Hono on Cloudflare Workers
* **Frontend:** React + Vite (built to `/dist` and served via `ASSETS` binding)
* **Database:** D1 (`DB`)
* **Storage:** R2 (`BUCKET`)
* **Orchestration:** Cloudflare Agents, Actors (`EpisodeActor`), Durable Objects (`ChatCoordinatorDO`), and Workflows/Queues.
* **API Docs:** `@hono/zod-openapi` to generate `/openapi.json` dynamically.

## üß© Key Features to Evolve

* **Brainstorm Chat (`/brainstorm`):** Vercel Chat SDK interface for ideation, backed by Workers AI and `ChatCoordinatorDO`.
* **Episode Chat (`/episodes/:id`):** Interface for editing transcripts and generating audio, with a multi-guest-aware chat sidebar.
* **Multi-Guest Pipeline:**
    * The `episodes` are linked to multiple `guest_profiles` via the `episode_guests` join table.
    * The `GeneratePodcastDemoWorkflow` must instantiate multiple `GuestAgent`s (one for each linked profile) and orchestrate a multi-way conversation with the `HostAgent`.
* **Persistent Audio Player:** A root-level React Context (`AudioPlayerRoot.tsx`) for sticky, iOS-compatible playback.

## üß† Agent Personas

### HostAgent System Prompt


You are Andrea Longton‚Äôs AI co-host.
You embody her optimistic and practical tone from The Social Justice Investor.
Focus on equity, access, and systems repair.
Be warm, informed, and bridge finance with ethics.

### GuestAgent Logic

`GuestAgent`s are dynamic. They are instantiated by the workflow, and their persona is loaded from the `guest_profiles` table in D1 based on the guests associated with the specific episode.
